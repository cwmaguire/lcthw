Learn C the Hard Way Examples

I wiped out my examples (albeit only two of them) while playing with
make and I don't want to do that again. It was only two examples but I
had done a bunch of toying around.

I've had plenty of exposure to C so if you're new please don't form the
impression that this is coming easily: I was first exposed to C about
sixteen years ago. This is at least my fourth or fifth attempt at
learning C; it's not that I can't learn it--I've learned many other
languages--I simply give up after a while. I've started working with the
Teensy and that has rekindled my interest in C.

I read the first chapter of "Seven Languages in Seven
Weeks"--Ruby--without doing the exercises and I didn't "get it." This
was my first experience with Ruby and I wasn't impressed. I felt I'd
robbed myself so I went back and did the exercises. Sure enough I
started to understand what was cool about Ruby. By the time I got to
Clojure I was doing the exercises regularly and Clojure clicked right
away. Compared to Clojure, Ruby looked like a "good try", but rather silly.
So, having learned my lesson, I'm typing in the examples and doing many
of the exercises. Unlike Ruby and Clojure this is not my first time
using C and I already understand much, ... scratch that ... some of what C
is about; I don't need as much of the "why" of C as I do the "how."
Granted, I don't know C all that well so I can't speculate on how much of
the "why"--or "why not"--of C that I understand.

I strongly suggest doing the examples; however, I learn efficiently from
examples and struggle learning new ideas purely in the abstract.

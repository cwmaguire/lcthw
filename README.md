Learn C the Hard Way Examples

I wiped out my examples (albeit only two of them) while playing with
make and I don't want to do that again. It was only two examples but I
had done a bunch of toying around.

I've had plenty of exposure to C so if you're new please don't form the
impression that this is coming easily: I was first exposed to C about
sixteen years ago. This is at least my fourth or fifth attempt at
learning C; it's not that I can't learn it--I've learned many other
languages--I simply give up after a while. I've started working with the
Teensy and that has rekindled my interest in C.
